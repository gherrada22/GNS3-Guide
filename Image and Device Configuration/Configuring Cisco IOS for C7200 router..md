## ðŸ”± Configuring Cisco IOS for C7200 router.

- If you are a network engineer you must know the most famous network simulator GNS3. From here you can download the Cisco 7200 series IOS for GNS3. But before I give you the download link, I want to discuss some features and advantages of GNS3 over the other network simulators.

- GNS3 is a graphical network simulator where you can create and build simple and complex network scenarios on your computer virtually. In this way, you test your configuration before implementing it in the real network. You can use different network devices with GNS3 such as routers, virtual PC, cloud, etc. [Here for more information](https://github.com/gherrada22/GNS3-Guide)

- The most attractive part of gns3 is that it uses the real Cisco IOS to simulate the network topology instead of programming. One disadvantage of GNS3 is that you cannot directly use the Switch IOS in GNS3, but there are many ways you can use the switch in GNS3. To switch functions in GNs3 requires Cisco IOS with NM-16ESW module. [Here is the link for GNS3 Switch IOS](#).


## ðŸ”° Important features

- IP BASE WITHOUT SSH
- BASE IP
- SP SERVICES
- ADVANCED SECURITY
- ADVANCED I.P. SERVICES
- ADVANCED BUSINESS SERVICES
- Special purpose feature sets
- ADVANCED IP SERVICES WITH LI
- ADVANCED BUSINESS SERVICES WITH SNASW

```
Note: Please note that this IOS image is for GNS3 use only. For commercial use, you must purchase it from your nearest Cisco.com or Cisco partner in your local region.
```

## âœ… Import Image in GNS3

In the GNS3 GUI, click `Edit > Preferences` to open the Preferences menu.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/8.jpg" width="400" />

In the preferences menu, select `IOS Routers and New`, to begin the process of importing an image.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/9.jpg" width="400" />

You will be asked which server you want to run the image on, but everything except `Run IOS router on my local computer` should be greyed out.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/10.jpg" width="400" />

(the option to run the image via the GNS3 virtual machine is not greyed out in the above image, as the GNS3 virtual machine was previously configured on this PC)

On the next screen, click `Browse` to import a compatible IOS image:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/11.jpg" width="400" />

Go to the folder where you have stored your Cisco IOS images, select the image and click `Open`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.telectronika.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/selecci%C3%B3n-del-ios-del-router-cisco.png" width="400" />

GNS3 can decompress IOS images to allow faster start-up of routers in your GNS3 topologies. This is recommended for a better user experience. Click `Yes` to decompress the image:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/13.jpg" width="400" />

```
âš  Important:
==============================================================================================================================================================
- By selecting "No", the compressed IOS Image will be kept, then, when the router is switched on at initialisation, the decompression process will be performed.
==============================================================================================================================================================
- Otherwise, if "Yes" is selected, the image will be decompressed, the loading will be much faster and the above described process of decompression during initialisation will not occur.
==============================================================================================================================================================
```

The directory where the uncompressed image is stored is displayed. Click `Next` to continue with the configuration:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.telectronika.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/carga-de-la-imagen-ios.png" width="400" />

The **Name and Platform** window appears. Confirm the platform selection and configure the router name. Click `Next`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.telectronika.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/asignaci%C3%B3n-de-nombre-y-selecci%C3%B3n-de-la-plataforma.png" width="400" />

```
âš  Note:
==============================================================================================================================================================
- In "Name", you can place a name for each profile of the same IOS image where in each of these profiles you change the types of interfaces that will be installed, this will be seen later. If only one profile per image will be used, you can leave the default name.
==============================================================================================================================================================
- In "Platform", take into account that the IOS image must be compatible with the platform or Chassis, in this case the 7200 platform is selected.
==============================================================================================================================================================
- It is suggested (not mandatory) to know the characteristics of the chassis to know how the interfaces will be distributed.
==============================================================================================================================================================
```

A default RAM configuration is displayed. It is important that you check the minimum memory requirements of your router using the Cisco website. Click on the `Check minimum and maximum RAM requirement` option:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/16.jpg" width="400" />

Cisco Feature Navigator opens in your default web browser. Select Image Name and enter the name of the image you are using:


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/17.jpg" width="400" />


Set the default RAM value to the value recommended by Cisco Feature Navigator (yours may be different from the screenshot) and click `Next`:

<p align="center">

Select your preferred network adapters. This depends on the device.

NOTE: Data obtained from Cisco.com. For more information, click on the interface name to go to the Cisco website and get the data for each interface.

Different interfaces can be selected for each slot. Once selected, click `Next`:

To finish the router configuration, we look for an Idle-PC which aims to optimise the resources of our equipment (PC, laptop, server, etc.).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.telectronika.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image-34.png" width="400" />


If a green Idle-PC value is NOT displayed, click the `Idle-PC finder` button to find an Idle-PC value:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/24.jpg" width="400" />

If you selected the `Idle-PC finder` button (only necessary if no value was automatically detected), GNS3 will calculate a value:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/25.jpg" width="400" />

(note that this may take a few minutes, depending on the speed of your PC) An Idle-PC value is displayed. Click `OK` to complete:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/26.jpg" width="400" />

```
âš  IMPORTANT:
If no Idle-PC value is displayed, try clicking the Idle-PC finder button again. You may also need to restart the computer and try again if no value is found. It is incredibly important to have an Idle-PC value when using IOS compatible images. Without this value, DynaMIPS cannot prevent an instance of an IOS image from consuming 100% of a CPU core or hardware thread (in the case of hyperthreading capable CPUs).
```

Click `Finish` to complete the GNS3 Setup Wizard:


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://docs.gns3.com/img/getting-started/setup-wizard-local-server/27.jpg" width="400" />

In this case, the IDLE PC value has already been specified, according to the value shown on this page, so you can click `Finish`, instead of going through the IDLE-PC search process.

The Preferences window appears, showing the settings you have configured through the Configuration Wizard. Click `Apply` and `OK`.

***`Congratulations`, you are now ready to create your first GNS3 topologies!***
